# hello-world
I have no idea what I'm doing.

I'm currently finishing undergraduate degrees in psychology and sociology at UNC Charlotte.
In addition, I'm minoring in cognitive science and involved in Psi Chi psychology honors society, 
Alpha Kappa Delta sociology honors society, and the National Society of Collegiate Scholars. 

I am always busy.
